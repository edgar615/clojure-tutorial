;; Sometimes you want to place a time limit on how long to wait for a future.
;; To do that, you can pass deref a number of milliseconds to wait along with the value to return if the deref times out:

;; This code tells deref to return the value 5 if the future doesnâ€™t return a value within 10 milliseconds.
(deref (future (Thread/sleep 1000) 0) 10 5)
;; => 5

;; Finally, you can interrogate a future using realized? to see if itâ€™s done running:
(realized? (future (Thread/sleep 1000)))
;; => false

(let [f (future)]
  @f
  (realized? f))
;; => true
